"Table 3: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Error Reduction (ER, in %) and Error Standard Deviation Reduction(SDR, in %) of TiSe and TiSe-Q compared to SVM. Both TiSe and TiSe-Q achieved significant SDR reduction, though RMSE increased in several cases for TiSe. In bold is the method with the lowest RMSE. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
