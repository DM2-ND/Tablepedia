"Table 4: SVM results: Comparing RBF kernel, GMML, SimpleMKL, Laplacian kernel and Isolation Kernel. GMML and Sim- pleMKL have ¡°out of memory¡± error on 2 datasets; SimpleMKL cannot return any result within 24 hours on 5 datasets. The rst and second subsets consists of 2-class datasets having less than and more than 5000 points, respectively; the third subset consists of multi-class datasets. ",,,,,,,,
