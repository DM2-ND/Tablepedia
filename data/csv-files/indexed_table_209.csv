Table 2: Accuracy (mean¡Àstd.) comparison on regular scale data sets. Linear kernels are used. The best accuracy on each data set is bolded. _/_ indicates the performance is significantly better/worse than SVM (paired t-tests at 95% significance level). The win/tie/loss counts are summarized in the last row. ,,,,,
