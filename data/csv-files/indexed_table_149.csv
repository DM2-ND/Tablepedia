Table 6: Accuracy (in terms of F1 and AUC) of the competing methods on four di erent datasets. DiffQue is run with its default con guration. Boldface numbers are the accuracy of the baseline methods using the con guration reported in the original papers. Blue (red) numbers are the accuracies of the best performing (second-ranked) method. We also measure the accuracy of each competing method using the network suggested by other methods and notice that most of the methods perform better if DiffQue¡¯s network is fed into their models (which indeed shows the superiority of our network construction mechanism). ,,,,,,,,,,
