"Table 2: Performance of the baseline methods and the interdependence model with di erent prediction methods. A number in a bracket indicates the ranking of each method. Winners are bold-faced. ES and ES+ outperform the baseline methods in most cases when the performance is evaluated by 0/1 loss. Our methods achieves higher accuracies and F1 scores than the baseline methods in Birds, Enron, and Medical. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
