"Table 4: Comparisons of graph embeddings between MILE and its variants. Except for the original methods (DeepWalk and NetMF), the number of coarsening level m is set to 1 on PPI/Blog/Flickr and 6 on YouTube. Mi-F1 is the Micro-F1 score in 10_2 scale while Time column shows the running time of the method in minutes. ¡°N/A¡± denotes the method consumes more than 128 GB RAM. ",,,,,,,,
