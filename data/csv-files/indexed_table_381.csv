"Table 8: MAP and NDCG@10 of retrieval methods on Robust-04, WT10g, and Gov2 collections where the superscript means significantly higher using a paired t-test (p < 0.05) compared to the standard maximum likelihood query model (e.g. DQMcJM vs JM, and DQMqJM vs JM). _ means significantly higher than TLM, and _ means significant higher compared to BM25 and TLM. Best result in bold. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
