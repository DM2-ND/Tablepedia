"Table 2: Average inter-sequence distance (ISD), average no. containing sequences (CS) and no. unique items for the top 50 non-singleton sequences returned by the algorithms from the datasets. Larger inter-sequence distances and smaller no. containing sequences indicate less redundancy. * returned less than 50 non-singleton sequences. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
