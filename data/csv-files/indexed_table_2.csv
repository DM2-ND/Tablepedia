"Table 4: Operative Mortality: Comparing performance of weighted methods versus Target + Source (Un- weighted). Estimated precision, recall, and AUC are shown for Isolated AVR, Isolated MVR, and Isolated MV Repair procedures at each hospital. The best precision, recall, and AUC are in bold. McNemar¡¯s test p-values for differences between weighted methods and Target + Source (Unweighted) are shown for each task. ",,,,,,,,
