Table 3: DDI detection performance. Prec@k stands for precision@k where k equals to the number of known DDI pairs and AP is the average precision. Mean and standard de- viation of 5 random splits are given for the proposed method and baselines with similarity function. Baselines without similarity learning were reported for a single test split. ,,
