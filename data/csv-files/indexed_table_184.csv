Table 4: Improvement of Max Permanence with respect to the average (left-hand value) and the best (right- hand value) performances of the six competing algorithms (separated by semicolon). Positive (negative) values indicate that Max Permanence outperforms (underperforms) the corresponding performances of the competing algorithms. ,,,,,,
