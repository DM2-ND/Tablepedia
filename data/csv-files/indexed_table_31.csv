"Table 8: M-MLkNN versus MLkNN on hamming loss, ranking loss, coverage, one error and average precision. Each result is an average over 10 trials of 10-fold cross-validation and its standard error. For the first four performance measures, the lower the better; for the last one, the higher the better. ",,,,,
