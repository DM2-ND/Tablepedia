"Table 2: LETOR 4.0 Results. The regression-only method performs best on Mean Squared Error (MSE), while the ranking-only method performs best on the rank-based metrics Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). The combined CRR method performs nearly as well as the ranking-only method on MAP and NDCG, with MSE approaching that of the regression-only method. The baseline results for RankSVM are previously reported benchmark results [18]. ",,,,,,
