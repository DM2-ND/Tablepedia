"Table 3: Classification error rates on the benchmark datasets (error rates are in %). Models: SVM-RBF: SVM with RBF kernels. SVM-Poly: SVM with polynomial kernels. NNet: (MLP) Feed-forward results from [18]. The best results obtained by all these models are marked in bold.  neural net. GSM: Gated softmax classifier. NonGSM: Non- factored gated softmax classifier. SAA-3: Three-layer stacked auto-associator. RBM: Restricted boltzmann machine. SUGAR-3: Three-layer stacked SUGAR. The results of SVM-RBF, SVM-Poly, NNet, SAA-3 and RBM are taken from [15], GSM and NonGSM ",,,,,,,,
