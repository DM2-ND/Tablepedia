"Table 1: Results and statistics for large-scale Multilabel data sets, Ntrain= number of training samples, Ntest= number of testing samples, Ttrain = training time, Ttest = testing time, K = number of classes, D = number of features. P@k = top-k accuracy. DiSMEC and PPDSparse are parallelized with 100 cores. We highlight the best result for each metric, except that for Ttrain we highlight best results among single-core solvers (le four) and parallel solvers. For all experiments, we set a memory limit to be 100G. Experiments that exceeded limits are marked Memory Limit Exceeded (MLE). ",,,,,,,
