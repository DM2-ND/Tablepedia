"Table 3: Retrieval performance evaluated by MAP and corresponding Hamming Radius to Search (HRS). We retrieve 500 nearest entities for evaluation. For MuCH-S, the bit number in second row represents the bit number of single hash table, and the number of hash tables is 4. For MuCH-F, the bit number in second row represents the total bit number of all hash tables, and the number of hash tables is 2. ",,,,,,,,
