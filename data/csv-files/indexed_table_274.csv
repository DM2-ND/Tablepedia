"Figure 4: Prior and posterior precision, recall and F-score of 3 neural models (LE, AV and IAV), 2 baselines (Empiri- cal and Empirical-P) and the IAV model in high-recall mode. The neural models outperform the baselines; the IAV raw model achieves the highest F-score when operating at 95% precision. ",,,,,,
