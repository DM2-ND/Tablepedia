"Table 3: Performance of various composite retrieval approaches in the heterogeneous web environment based on FSC (Federated Search Central): central ranking of mixture of all verticals. Pairwise t-test significance test is applied, and values marked with Y_(p- value=0.05), IJ(p-value=0.01) and Z_(p-value=0.05), I_(p-value=0.01) indicate respectively significant improvements or deterioration over baseline (FSC).
