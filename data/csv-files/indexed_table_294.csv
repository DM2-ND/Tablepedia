"Table 4: Classification comparison of using multi-modality data (iMSF and ScoreComp) and using the complete MRI + CSF + PET + Proteomics data. Classification is performed on the same set of samples, so that a fair comparison can be made. Leave-one-out is used and the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are reported. ",,,,,,,,,
