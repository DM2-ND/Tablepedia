"Table 3: Comparison of classification accuracy (%) with state-of-art DML methods. ¡°Dropout¡± refers to the best result of dropout from Table 2. Note that LMNN is a batch learning algorithm, and there is no limitation for the triplets it uses and the number of PSD projections. The best result is bolded (statistical significance examined via pairwise t-tests at the 5% significance level). Table 4: Comparison of classification accuracy (%) for SPML and its variants by wrapping different dropout strategies in. The best result is bolded.
