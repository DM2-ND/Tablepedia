"Table 2: Operative Mortality: Comparing Target + Source (Unweighted) to Random, Target-only, Source- only, and STS baselines. Estimated precision, recall, and AUC are shown for Isolated AVR, Isolated MVR, and Isolated MV Repair procedures at each hospital. The best precision, recall, and AUC are in bold. Random precision (incidence in the population), recall (0.20), and AUC (0.50) are shown in the top row for each experiment. The Target-only performance for Isolated MV Repair at Hospital 1 is missing because there were not enough positive examples to develop a model (only two adverse events). Target + Source (Unweighted) performance is better than Target-only performance on all tasks, and it is comparable to STS performance for all six tasks (p-values from McNemar¡¯s test > 0.05). ",,,,,,
