"Table 5: Robustness of various composite retrieval approaches to initial ranking quality. All systems are measured by nDCG@10. Pairwise t-test significance test is applied, and values marked with Y_(p-value=0.05), IJ(p-value=0.01) and Z_(p-value=0.05), I_(p- value=0.01) indicate respectively significant improvements or deterioration over the original ranking.
