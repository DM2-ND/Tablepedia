# Tablepedia: Annotated dataset for WWW 2020 paper 

## Introduction 
This repositories contains source dataset for WWW 2020 paper:

**[Experimental Evidence Extraction in Data Science with Hybrid Table Features and Ensemble Learning](https://wyu97.github.io/papers/C2_WWW_2020.pdf)** <br>
Authors: Wenhao Yu (ND), Wei Peng (ZJU), Yu Shu (SCU), Qingkai Zeng (ND), Meng Jiang (ND)

> This paper propose a novel system that _extracts_ experimental evidences from data science literature in PDF format and _builds up_ the first experimental database for related research.

The left figure is the workflow of Tablepedia system: (1) PDF collection, (2)table extraction, (3) experimental evidence database construction, (4)database operations and visualization.

The right figure is an example DB constructed by Tablepedia from data science paper PDFs. For a dataset and an evaluation metric, one can use the database to check what the state-of-the-art (highlighted in yellow) is and whether the reported numbers in existing research are consistent (green box) or conflicting (red box).
