## Introduction 
This repositories contains source dataset for WWW 2020 paper:

**[Experimental Evidence Extraction in Data Science with Hybrid Table Features and Ensemble Learning](https://wyu97.github.io/papers/C2_WWW_2020.pdf)** <br>
Authors: Wenhao Yu (ND), Wei Peng (ZJU), Yu Shu (SCU), Qingkai Zeng (ND), Meng Jiang (ND)

> This paper propose a novel system that _extracts_ experimental evidences from data science literature in PDF format and _builds up_ the first experimental database for related research.
